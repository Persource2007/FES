Subject: FES Stories - Progress Update & Client Questions Needed

Hi [Senior Developer Name],

Quick update on today's progress:

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
Frontend: React 18.2.0, Vite 5.0.8, React Router DOM 6.20.1, Axios 1.6.2, React Toastify 9.1.3, React Icons 4.12.0, Tailwind CSS 3.3.6
Backend: Lumen (Laravel Micro-framework), PHP 8.4, PostgreSQL 18.1, Composer
Development Tools: Node.js, npm, PostgreSQL, pgAdmin 4

COMPLETED:
- User management system (CRUD operations) with role-based access control
- Super admin and Reader roles implemented
- Activity tracking system (login, user create/update/delete events)
- Sidebar navigation with role-based menu items
- Updated Swagger documentation with all API endpoints
- Protected routes and authentication flow

CURRENT STATUS:
- Login working with role information in response
- User management restricted to Super admin only
- Activities stored in localStorage (ready to migrate to backend)
- Password verification currently disabled for development

NEED CLIENT CLARIFICATION:
Before implementing token architecture, we need answers on:

1. Token Type: JWT, OAuth 2.0, or custom? Token expiration time?
2. Token Payload: What info should be included (user ID, email, role, permissions)?
3. Token Storage: localStorage, HTTP-only cookies, or memory?
4. Roles & Permissions: Complete list of roles and their specific permissions needed
5. Role Management: Will they manage roles or should we build a role management system?
6. Role in Token: Should role/permissions be in token or fetched separately?

Once we have these answers, estimated 5-8 days for full token + RBAC implementation.

All changes documented in CHANGELOG.md. Swagger docs updated at backend/api-docs/swagger.yaml.

Let me know if you want to review the client questions before we send them.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
